These are the notes and link to resources that I am creating while learning aws.

## On-premise-vs-Cloud-Infrastructre:
So starting of, you must be wondering what is cloud and how is it diffrent from On Premise infrastructure which means having your own physical servers at a place. So lets discuss about it:

Lets discuss the points given in the above image:

## On-premise-Infrastructure:

Since we are setting up our own physical servers in this infrastructure, it requires high investment firstly to find a place and to purchase servers as well. Although the resources are deployed in-house which means you have complete control over the data. But one of the major issue with this infrastructure is that it is very tough to scale this system because of physical servers. You can imagine how tough it would be to purchase new servers everytime and also keep the maintainance of the old one's which is also very important.

## Cloud-Infrastructure:

Now as we go through this part you will find many advantages of using cloud over physical servers. Firstly it works on pay as you go model which means we have to pay according to the storage or technology we require and also the amount of users we are handelling which is better that making huge starting investment for buying physical servers. Although the deployment takes place on a third party platform which can create loss of authority of data which reduces the crediblity. But one of the biggest advantage of moving in cloud is scalability and elasticity. You have seen live streams on diffrent platform reaching 1 to 2 crore viewership sometimes. These numbers are managed by the flexibility of cloud infrastructure which helps us to upscale when users are more and even scale down when viewrs are less which is a game changer.
